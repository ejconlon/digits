TODO
figure out tensorflow reporting
baseline to k-NN


Final product
classification of street numbers
to do that, a multi-stage pipeline

1) scan over the image at a variety of scales for numbers
2) maximal extent?
3) detection in individual boxes


workflow:
command includes

op args

post ideas
"more data better than better algorithms"
split your pipeline up
there will be slow parts
visualize long-running processes
figure out where to divide work
standardize metrics and criteria
make sure you can still run it on one machine
make it easy to explore results
plan for heterogeneity
types of testing
- stable results
- no crash
- watermark
- replay
- controlled data
